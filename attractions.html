                <h2>The pyramids</h2>
                <p>The 3 Pyramids of Giza 
                    are ancient tombs from the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The 3 pyramids 
                    were built by the following pharaohs: Khufu, Menkaure, and Khafre.
                     They were built as symbols of power and burial places for the 
                     pharaohs.</p>

                <h2>Khan El Khalili</h2>
                <p>
                    Khan El Khalili is hands down the most iconic bazaar in Egypt, right in the heart of Cairo's 
                    historic Islamic district. Steeped in history since the 14th century, this vibrant market is
                     like a maze of alleys brimming with treasures, gold jewelry, leather goods, spices, and unique
                      souvenirs.
