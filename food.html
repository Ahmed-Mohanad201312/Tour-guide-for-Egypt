        Also spelled koshari or kushari 
        , it is widely considered Egypt's
         national dish. Rice, lentils 
         (black or brown), chickpeas and 
         pasta are cooked individually, 
         then tossed together and topped 
         with cumin-scented tomato sauce 
         and crunchy fried onions.

            <p>
ful Wa Ta'ameya is a popular and delicious
 Egyptian street food that has been enjoyed 
 for centuries. This dish consists of two main
  components: Ful, which is mashed fava beans
   that are cooked with a variety of spices,
    and Ta'ameya, which are falafel-like patties
     made from ground fava beans, herbs, and spices.
